## Key Features Explained

### Cost Calculation Methodology

The application uses a comprehensive approach to calculate total cost of ownership:

1. **Initial Cost**: Purchase price of the vehicle
2. **Operating Costs**: 
   - Fuel costs (gasoline) or electricity costs (EV)
   - Maintenance costs per mile
   - Annual insurance premiums
3. **Inflation Adjustment**: All future costs are adjusted for inflation
4. **Resale Value**: Estimated resale value discounted to present value

### Real-world Considerations

The calculator includes several real-world factors:
- **Inflation**: Future costs increase over time
- **Time Value of Money**: Money today is worth more than money in the future
- **Variable Costs**: Fuel/electricity prices and maintenance costs vary by vehicle type
- **Depreciation**: Different vehicles depreciate at different rates
